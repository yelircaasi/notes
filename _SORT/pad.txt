Concepts: 
- SAID principle: That’s “specific adaptations to imposed demand.”
- periodization - the organizational structure that guides your progress and gets you from “A” to “B”   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_periodization
- progressive overload
- endurance
- split weight training https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_weight_training

Workout Types:
- AMRAP: as many repetitions as possible
- 1-rep max (SRM, single-rep maximum)
- AMRAP multi-set decreasing n, with fixed break length
-  rhythm: 4-number tempo code such as 3/1/4/2, meaning an eccentric phase lasting 3 seconds, a pause of 1 second, a concentric phase of 4 seconds, and another pause of 2 seconds
- rest time: 60-160s

Notes:
- critical ingredient: mechanism for dynamically adapting declaration to current circumstances

- also use NRM, nine-rep maximum
- jsonize this table/page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_weight_training_exercises


General algorithm:
Find 1RM for each exercise; due to impossibility of getting SRM, get SRM for a few key exercises, then attempt other exercises and adjust upwards


Target medium loads of 8-12 repetitions at 60-80% of SRM, alternating between different muscle groups and exercise types

Algorithmic considerations:
- how many sessions per week
- how many sessions per day
- length of the session
- permissible exhaustion (depending on what comes afterward)
- access to gym & probable access to equipment (function of day & time)

Ideas:
- may be best to discard weekly 7-day cadence and simply follow n-day rhythm where n \in {2, 3, 4, 5}    -> still need to plan around workdays due to gym access
    -> nah - weekly cadence is probably the most effective, due to no gym for 2 days
    -> maybe add one extra lunchtime / after-work workout to have 6 workouts during the week;
        weekend may be appropriate for rest days / relaxing long-distance jogging days
- create function to assign overall difficulty to a run based on elevation loss/gain in addition to distance and time (also possible to take some Gini-like function of incline to differentiate between long gentle slopes and short steep slopes, but this may be negligible)

Exampl with 3-day cadence:
M  push, run[intense] 
T   pull, run[moderate]
W  legs, no run, mild swim
Th   push, run[intense] 
F      pull, run[moderate]
Sa    intense run
Su    bodyweight exercises, run
