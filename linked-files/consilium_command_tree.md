Making an all-in-one solution brings with it 'economies of scale', where having things centrally controlled makes some aspects of inter-module integration easier.

Currently, this code is scattered throughout the following repos:

* [consilium](https://github.com/yelircaasi/consilium)
* [notes](https://github.com/yelircaasi/notes)
* [jn](https://github.com/yelircaasi/jn)
* [nebokrai-data](https://github.com/yelircaasi/nebokrai-data)
* [nebokrai](https://github.com/yelircaasi/nebokrai)
* [nebokrai-python-prototype](https://github.com/yelircaasi/nebokrai-python-prototype)
