# Autoepistemography

  * 0-6 - peaceful and happy indoctrinatio
  * 7-10 - acceptance of evolution without seeing any conflict
* good experience with baptism
* little questioning
* interest in science
  * 11-13 - Mormon Doctrine and other teachings
* first red flags and difficult search for answers
* reinforced sense of difference and need to hold strong to my heritage and beliefs, "stranger in a strange land"
* German liberal values
* tolerable questions - conflict with evolution
* beginning of serious questions regarding us vs. them, theology regarding others, what determines morality, what
  * 14-18 - smooth, all in, some questions
    issues with polygamy in high school
    exposure to weird stuff in the old testament
    intensive study of evolutionary theory
    other questions about science and religion
    certainty in the foundational claims of the restoration and of Christianity
    conservative political outlook
  * 19-22 - difficult questions before my mission, but need to settle them or sweep them under the rug - polygamy and racism
    prophetic fallibility
    disturbing endowment ceremony
    occasional questions about sexism
    qualms about missionary tactics, high-pressure sales, whitewashing
    characteristics of people interested in the church and methods used to explain them (poverty, humility,
    effort to make missionary work genuinely beneficial
    issues with imperialism
    intelligent, nuanced mission president
    weird stuff about the gathering of Israel
    bizarre doctrine about blood changing - actually falsifiable
  * 23 - real faith crisis, help from a wonderful bishop
    full exposure to some of the horrible acts
  * 24 - intensive study - philosophy, church history, sociology & mehods of control, social psychology, psychology of belief
    exposure to the full spectrum of issues
    wondering about informed believers (Mason, Givens, Bushman)
    Noam Chomsky & manufactured consent
    seeing through American nationalism and American exceptionalism
    questioning my parents' insensitivity and snobbery
    conclusion based on the ensemble of evidence
    began to question God and Christianlty and religion in general as well
    questioning the capacity for rational, unbiased thought at all
