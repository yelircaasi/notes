# Relationship Strategies 
  
(This list is recorded as developed through experience, advice received, and collaboration with fellow missionaries; some female input was received. However, the thoughts and phrasings are essentially my own.)

Friendship first: stable basis for a relationship

Honesty: not showing or expressing more affection than you feel (less physically)

Social discipline: exercising restraint to avoid saying or doing embarrassing things

Observation: “looking before you leap”, examining character by watching

Realness: maximizing real, face-to-face communication, minimizing electronic communication

Pace: slowing down the process of emotional attachment to avoid premature decisions

Restraint: not holding hands until the second date, no kissing until the second date or later

Utility maximization: playing to your strengths

Humility: avoiding the social repellent of pride to minimize negative feelings

Competitiveness: being the right one for the right one  by having the right skills and qualities

Directness: straightforwardly and eloquently expressing one’s feelings at opportune moments

Romance: careful planning, honest and tactful compliments, thoughtful surprises (timing, atmosphere, courage, sincerity)

Win-win mentality: being happy for the successes and happiness of others

Mystery: keeping people guessing until the time is right (i.e. when it is no longer advantageous to have unknown intentions)
