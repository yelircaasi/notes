# Proglang Table

* parallang
  * Create a website with a giant table to compare programming languages.
  * Each row is some (relatively universal) feature or aspect of programming languages.
  * Source     code for the website is a markdown file for each language and builder    code (heavily template-based) to generate html+css+js, as well as    interact with the source (e.g. add a row to all files, with default    "\<to be added...\>" placeholder).
  * Languages     should be selectable, as should feature categories and features. The    table should then be exportable in different formats.
  * The site should also support custom theming.
  * make interactive website where it is possible to pick languages to compare - like hyperpolyglot, but with an interactive component8
  * also add links to projects
