* A Note to the Reader


* 2. Easy Does It

* * focused mode vs. diffuse mode: tight vs. loose pinball machine
* * ”don’t jump into the water before learning how to swim”
* * don’t try to force creativity
* * embrace confusion, then get over it

* 3. Learning is Creating

* * example of Thomas Edison and Salvador Dali
* * learn from errors
* * there are deep connections between technical, scientific, and artistic creativity
* * diffuse mode - go back and forth to master material
* * diffuse mode activators: gym, soccer, sports, run, walk, dance, drive, draw, paint,

* 4. Chunking and Avoiding Illusions of Competence

* * top-down learning: big picture
* * bottom-up learning: chunking
* * chunking process: focused attention, understanding, practice
* * different between focused and diffuse learning
* * organize, chunk, apply
* * recall material outside your usual place of study
* * review important material daily to keep it at the tip of your tongue

* interleaving vs. overlearning (variety of problems in a study session, moving on after you master one area)

* * (aside) - actively seek good advice

* 5. Preventing Procrastination

* * just get started
* * focus on the enjoyable parts of a task and the benefits of finishing
* * set aside time for focused studies

* 10. Enhancing Your Memory

* * memory palace technique
* * be creative in your memorization techniques, and disciplined as well
* * understand before you memorize

* 11. More Memory Tips

* * metaphors can help you learn new ideas quickly
* * repetition is critical and helps you firm up what you want to memorize
* * meaningful groups and abbreviations allow you to simplify and chunk
* * stories are useful in trying to help you retain what you are trying to learn
* * writing and speaking help with memorization
* * exercise is critical in helping to develop new connections between neurons

* 12. Learning to Appreciate Your Talent

* * once you truly have something mastered, you don’t have to consciously understand every step of the process every time
* * sometimes being “slow” can have its advantages, including in creativity
* * don’t be intimidated to work with students who grasp material more quickly than I do
* * part of the key to creativity is being able to switch from full focus to a dreamy diffuse mode
* * don’t force yourself to focus, just learn to want to engage in the task at hand
* * sometimes whe you’re stuck, it helps to just move away from a problem or sleep on it, then come back to it later

* 13. Sculpting Your Brain

* * initial failure does not need to be permanent
* * learning to abstract key ideas can be a great source of success
* * metaphors and physical analogies can bring together knowledge from very different spheres
* * keep your mind open to learning new things; don’t be quick to label yourself; well-roundedness is power

* 14. Developing the Mind’s Eye through Equation Problems

* * remeber that equations are just a way of abstracting and simplifying concepts, so learn to see their deeper meaning
* * use your “mind’s eye”
* * transfer: the ability to take what you learn and apply it to something else
* * it’s important to really grasp the concept, because that will make transfer easier
* * dn’t try to multitask

* 15. Renaissance Learning

* * learn to learn on your own, and take responsibility for your own learning
* * examples: Ben Carson, William Kamkwamba, Snatiago Ramon y Cajal
* * take advantage of the opportunity to learn from great teachers
* * go above and beyond required class material
* * don’t pay attention to “intellectua snipers” (those who are excessively negative and prone to put you down)
* * realize the advantages of a “slower” way of thinking - seeing the forest from the trees, noticing detail, etc.
* * learn to use negatively-perceived qualities and harness them for learning

* 16. Avoiding Overconfidence

* * work problems and test yourself without looking at the answers to avoid “illusions of competence”
* * take regular looks at the “big-picture”; do “reality checks” to avoid fixation
* * find valuable brainstorming partners, who can be blunt, critical, and who sometimes think differently than you do
* * check and review your work regularly and at different times and in different settings
* * “The Strength of Weak Ties”
* * think about what equations mean, so that the math and your inuition match; see the underlying story and avoid the “plug and chug” method

* 17. Test Taking

* * learn by testing yourselftest-preparation checklist:
* * make a serious effort to understand the text
* * work with classmates on homework problems and check solutions with others
