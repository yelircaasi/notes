# Marriage Notes

What a good marriage would look like:

* shared goals: be good parents for Leni, be happy together, have good careers
* good financial management and good household
* shared household responsibilities; process and system that we both buy into and that leave each feeling like an equal partner
* mutual support with good habits: healthy eating, workouts, good sleep schedules, moderate consumption (food, Netflix, YouTube, games), reasonable frugality
* shared interests and hobbies: Leni, board games, discovering new movies, book to read together
* friends - important to have other social contacts, which helps us to see each other with new eyes and helps us avoid getting in a rut
* trust - transparent communication, honesty, no cheating, no spying, no paranoia
* weekly date (typically high-quality, high-effort)
* dating mentality - find ways to keep the relationship fresh and beat complacency
* both elements of a healthy marriage present: companionate love (quality friendship) and erotic love (attraction, intimacy, good sex life)

Concerns:

* trust - how can Sandra trust me again? How can she avoid feeling paranoid about what I think and feel
* potential for resentment - anytime there are two good options, there is the potential for bitterness and regret over what was given up
* old habits - compulsive/addictive behaviors, self-isolation and increased distance between partners, condescension, dismissiveness, insults and hurtful communication
* psychological adjustment - how can Isaac fill the gap that has been variously filled by online projects, Wizard, language exchange, online flirting, and Polina? Can Sandra really fill the gap left by hours of Netflix and/or online gaming?
* triggers - each of us has things that provoke us in ways that might seem extreme or irrational. For Isaac, these include perceived disinterest or condescension and the perception of a “I don’t want you but I don’t want anyone else to have you” mentality. For Sandra, this includes anything that feels verbally abusive, such as attacks on her character or appearance, and also anything that triggers her fear of being cheated on
* complacency - “We’re already married and he/she is contractually obligated to like me the way I am, so I don’t need to make an effort anymore”
* communication - so many high-stakes discussions end in unproductive and bitter fights - two oldest children with big egos in the same relationship
* boredom/frustration - how can we keep marriage from feeling stale and intellectually, sexually, and socially unfulfilling (even imprisoning)?
* imbalance in responsibilities - Sandra doing everything with bureaucracy, taxes, etc., leaving her feeling overworked and like the only adult in the relationship, and Isaac feeling out-of-the-loop, incompetent, and infantilized
* hurt and resentment - is it even possible to get rid of the baggage we carry, or is it too far gone and too toxic, and we both need a fresh start with someone else?
* Leni - she is a major factor in this, and one that, in all honesty, has made it more difficult to pull the plug completely when we might otherwise have done so. A toxic relationship would be worse for her than a divorce, and a divorce later on would be more traumatic for her than a divorce now
