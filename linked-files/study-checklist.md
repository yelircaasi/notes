# Study Checklist

• A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate

• Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time

• Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone

• a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.

• Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.

•Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy

* Reminder:After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me.

* You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book.

* I hope y'all had a good day, if not, that's okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight
