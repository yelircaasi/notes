# Polyglot Phraseological Database

Main Questions / Thoughts:

What data structure and format is best for our purposes?

Which database type?

What are the difference use cases for the database / corpus?

How can we create a semantic transcription for each phrase?

* universal semantic language
* Anna Wierzbicka (esp. on semantic primes and USM)
* semantic features
* semantic universals
* cross-lingual semantic language
* computational semantics
* [Semantic analysis for Corpus Linguistics](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J93-2005.pdf)

## How to classify proverbs?


## Brainstorming

* Create a large multilingual resource containing idiomatic expression and proverbs, and possibly other non-analytic collocations        > develop semantic representations of both literal and figurative meanings of units        > identify values/morals as well as literal SVO        > dual classification scheme: literal and figurative meaning, network data structure

## Features:

* Basic phrase text
* Variants
* Equivalents (lists of exact, close, and distant matches on both literal and figurative similarity)
* Literal semantic transcription(s) (each unambiguous)
* Figurative semantic transcription(s) (each unambiguous)        (temporary?) Literal meaning in English        (temporary?) Figurative meaning in English        (?) List of entity codes (WordNet-style hierarchical code, marked as subject, object, neither)        (?) List of entity codes (WordNet-style hierarchical code)
* Register(s) & (if applicable) dialect
* Distance between literal and figurative (values? - identical, abstract word sense, close, stretch, entirely unapparent)
* Source(s)
* Earliest attestation
* Corpus frequency (corpus-frequency pair)
* Types (proverb, idiomatic expression, slang)
