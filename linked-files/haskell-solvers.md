# Haskell Solver Libraries

Solvers - ChatGPT Assistance

I want to write a Haskell problem that assigns tasks to times subject to a set of constraints and so as to optimize some metric. Can you name appropriate Haskell libraries for this purpose?

When writing a Haskell program to assign tasks to times subject to constraints and optimizing some metric, you are essentially dealing with a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) or a constraint optimization problem (COP). Several libraries in Haskell can help you with this task. Here are some appropriate libraries:

SBV (SMT Based Verification):

SBV allows you to solve CSPs and optimization problems using SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers.
It's well-suited for problems where you have logical constraints and need to find satisfying assignments.
Documentation: SBV on Hackage

Example:

```haskell
import Data.SBV

taskAssignment :: IO AllSatResult
taskAssignment = allSat $ do
    -- Define your variables and constraints here
    return ()
```

Z3:

Z3 is an SMT solver from Microsoft Research that can be used through Haskell bindings.
It's powerful for both solving constraints and optimization problems.
Documentation: z3 Haskell bindings on Hackage

Example:

```haskell
import Z3.Monad

taskAssignment :: Z3 (Result, Model)
taskAssignment = evalZ3 $ do
    -- Define your variables and constraints here
    return ()
```

glpk-hs:

GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) provides tools for solving linear programming and mixed integer programming problems.
Useful if your constraints and optimization metric can be expressed in linear form.
Documentation: glpk-hs on Hackage

Example:

```haskell
import Numeric.LinearProgramming

taskAssignment :: IO (OptSolution Double)
taskAssignment = do
    -- Define your problem here
    return ()
```

Monadic Constraint Programming (monadiccp):

This library provides monadic constructs for constraint programming.
Suitable for problems where you need more flexible and expressive constraints.
Documentation: monadiccp on Hackage

Example:

```haskell
import Control.CP.FD

taskAssignment :: IO ()
taskAssignment = runCP $ do
    -- Define your constraints and search strategy here
    return ()
```

Haskell-CAS (Constraint and Search):

A general-purpose library for constraint programming.
Provides various constraint solvers and search strategies.
Documentation: haskell-cas on Hackage

Example:

```haskell
import CAS

taskAssignment :: IO ()
taskAssignment = do
    -- Define your problem here
    return ()
```

Each of these libraries has its strengths and is suited for different kinds of problems. Choose the one that best matches the nature of your constraints and optimization metric. If your problem involves complex constraints and you need robust solving capabilities, using an SMT solver like SBV or Z3 might be the best choice. If your constraints are linear, then glpk-hs could be more appropriate. For more general and flexible constraint programming, monadiccp or haskell-cas can be very useful.
