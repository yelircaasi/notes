# Eliza Church Letter

    Hey Eliza,
    I got your letter where you asked me if I have ever had a “testimony crisis”, or anything of the sort. Here is my answer - I recommend printing it out to read when you have one of those rare spare moments, so it doesn’t cut into your precious email time.
    I have, several times, experienced intense doubt, since I do ask questions and love finding answers. Since I was 11, I have wanted to know all I can about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to reassure myself that I am spending my life on the right things, or to learn what other path I should take.
    I’m glad you asked, because I often feel like there is a stigma against asking tough questions, as if that implied weakness or a lack of faith, and I don’t think it should be that way. Questions, combined with an open mind and a pure heart, are the path to truth, and I love asking questions. I’m certainly glad Joseph Smith was willing to agonize over difficult questions with an open mind.
    As far as I can tell, this is a fairly comprehensive list of the doubts and objections people generally have with regard to the Church, and also what my thoughts and experience have been with them. More importantly, these are all things I have wondered about, and some of them I have thought long and hard about and lost hours of sleep over. This is more than you asked for, but I hope you find this helpful and/or interesting. It definitely applies to the work you’re doing, especially in a place as intellectually-oriented and secular as the Netherlands and Belgium. Let me know if you have more thoughts or questions with regard to any of these in particular.
  * Church histor
  * Blacks and the Priesthood - this is tough, and members only made it worse pre-1978 by thinking up non-doctrinal explanations. I wish this had never happened, but it’s a fact that even some of the greatest people have their prejudices. At the end of the day, I’m just glad to have been norn after the 1978 revelation. There is a great article about this: [lds.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng](https://www.lds.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng) . You’ll actually find a lot of good, well-written articles on the Church website: [lds.org/topics/](https://www.lds.org/topics/)
  * polygamy - This is something that is not easy for us, having been raised in a monogamous society with monogamous ideals, to accept, but it is in the Bible. Furthermore, most of the discomfort it causes is, as far as I can tell, due to an incomplete understanding of its purpose and practice. Like I would have been in their shoes, Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and others were repulsed by the idea and had no desire to practice it. One common argument for it is that there are probably more women than men who qualify for exaltation, but all need to be married. That seems plausible to me, but most importantly, it was a commandment revealed and also discontinued through the prophets
  * character of Joseph Smith and other Church leaders - The simple fact is that the Church leaders, admirable though they are, are imperfect people, and there is fortunately no doctrine of infallibility. It does make you wonder to read about the things they have said and done over the years that are out of harmony with the teachings of the Church, even their own. The Mountain Meadows Massacre, where some of the early Utahn settlers massacred a group of non-LDS pioneers, is an unfortunate example. It is easy to be become fixated on the shortcomings of great individuals and overlook all of the good they say and do, and so in addition to remembering that they are human and make mistakes, it is worth staying balanced when you take their actions into account - look at all the good they do, and weigh the unsavory bits against that, rather than focusing entirely on the negative
  * freemasonry and the Church - Freemasonry is an ancient organization with high standards and secret rituals and signs. Sound familiar? Joseph Smith was a Freemason and people have tried to make the case that he copied the temple ceremony from the Freemason ritual, but it’s clear from an informed study of each that he didn’t. I’ve looked into this, particularly in a good book on it we have, and there isn’t much to it. It’s interesting to think that the Mason ceremony may be a corrupted descendant of the temple ceremony form the last time it was known and practiced, but that is unfounded speculation
  * apostasy of prominent members - there was an unfortunate lot of this during the beginning era of this dispensation. Obviously, it can’t prove anything either way, but it can make you wonder. The other side of the coin, though, is that many of them came back, which took true humility and integrity to their knowledge of the truth. Many of the witnesses of the Book of Mormon, though they became opponents of Joseph Smith and the Church, and some of whom never came back, never denied their witness of the Book of Mormon. As one of my mission presidents, a lawyer by profession, pointed out, that kind of evidence carries a lot of weight even in the courtroom
  * some disturbing parts of the Old Testament, like the one where the Children of Israel are commanded to annihilate the several peoples living in the land of Canaan. On that specific example, I’ve heard the explanation put forth that that was an act of mercy, because the civilizations were so wicked that the Lord wouldn’t have wanted to send anyone there to grow up surrounded by such evil. Whether or not that is the case, the general principle, I think, is that the Lord knows all factors, and we do not. Best to trust omniscience. If the Old Testament were made into a movie without editing, you and I would not be able to watch it. I think part of the reason for so much gruesome and explicit content is that sexuality and violence are universal human themes and are as relevant today as ever; part of the reason for their inclusion in the Bible may be that they were living a lower law, but whatever the case, the inspiring doctrine, stories, and poetry of the Old Testament have me convinced that it is inspired scripture after all)
  * the Book of Abraham - the story about it involves Egyptian papyri that Joseph Smith got ahold of and translated in the earlt days of the Church. Since then, Egyptologists have investigated them and stated that the translation is nowhere near the meaning of the originals. There is an article giving background and a partial explanation: [lds.org/topics/](https://www.lds.org/topics/) . It makes the good point that the Book of Abraham speaks for itself, even if we don’t completely understand its origins. I don’t really understand this particular issue, but since it’s a part of a greater whole, I accept it on faith, and I’m confident I’ll know the whole story someday
  * Doctrines, like vicarious work for the dead, that are unique to the Church and therefore seen as “unchristian” - These make what is easily the flimsiest argument, advanced by the closed-minded Bible-worshippers who fail to understand the idea of the Restoration. These, to me, provide some of the greatest evidence that the Church is true
  * Process of feeling the Spirit - This doubt essentially focuses on whether feelings can be reliably accepted as data or proof of truth. Coming from those who have not felt the Spirit’s influence, it is like, say, a vegan who had never tasted meat trying to tell me that steak was not tasty. Scientifically, of course, feelings cannot furnish proof, but I believe that the great test of this life is to be true to one’s feelings and to recognize the light of Christ. Life is, after all, not only mental, but also emotional, and everything we do is ultimately directed toward happiness, which is a feeling
  * Bible-bashing - An enjoyable pastime that helps you become acquainted with the Bible, but not very effective in getting at the truth. The more you study the Bible, the more you see the continuity between it and the other 3 standard works. It is powerful how the Gospel is one unified whole, and how well the different parts of it fit together. To paraphrase someone else, the Book of Mormon can prove the Bible, but trying to prove the Book of Mormon through the Bible is, in my opinion, a waste of time. But for those willing to open their minds to the big picture, the Bible seen through the lens of the Restoration is a fascinating, beautiful thing. 2 Nephi 29 treats this very nicely
  * Scienc
  * evolution - Macroevolution, the idea that species change over time into other species, implying that humans evolved from other primates, is incompatible with the Gospel, and false. Microevolution, the idea that characteristics of animal species change slightly over time in response to their surroundings, is plausible, consistent with the Gospel, and actually empirically evidenced. Most people forget that evolution is itself treated more like a religion than like the theory it actually is, and the best argument against it is everything in life that it cannot account for
  * age of the Earth - elieved to be about 4.6 billion years, which is not inconsistent with anything we believe, unless you believe that the “days” of creation were literally 24-hour periods of time. Most objections of this nature are brought about by preudoscience and by unsubstantiated Biblical claims and other false doctrines
  * psychology, neuroscience, and determinism (the false and ridiculous idea that we cannot have free will because everything is dictated by chemical and physical processes, and thus have foregone conclusions) - I’m not terribly well-informed in these areas, but the general objection is the idea that our brain is responsible for all cognitive function. It certainly does a lot, but I tend to see the brain as a powerful tool closely tied to our spirit (maybe even analogous in some ways), but not as the origin of all thought and feeling. This is a fascinating topic I plan on learning much more about
  * the list goes on and one, but the simple truth is this: Truth never contradicts itself. True religion and true science are, in essence, one and the same
  * Offense or other objections based on the personal conduct of members, or even non-membership of wonderful people - These are certainly regrettable, but obviously irrelevant in a discussion of truth
  * Social and lifestyle issues, such as gay marriage, other LGBT issues - These are especially tricky in today’s society, and they rely mostly on pathos, or emotion, and so are hard to argue against. Fortunately, you don’t have to - people either accept the Lord’s commandments, or they don’t, so they have other questions (like the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, of course) to tackle first. I have found, though, that it goes a long way to explain that we love the sinner but hate the sins. (I flipped the two around once and it didn’t sound too good. Careful.) It’s also worth pointing out sometimes that “tolerance” can be very one-sided
  * Dislike of culture, whether in the Church, in UT, or so on  - This has been a big one for me. Turns out it’s usually just a specific manifestation of pride
  * Other doctrinal concerns, such as with the Plan of Salvation, nature of God - “Milk before meat” is always a good idea, but I’ve found that once you accept them on the faith you already have in the basics, they open up your perspective and leave you wondering what else the prophets know, but just can’t reveal because the hardness of our hearts
  * Feminism ideology - This is a tough one, and I give it some credence. Women certainly could have a greater voice within the Church community, but demanding the priesthood is silly, definitely the wrong kind of voice. Most of the discomfort this issue causes is because people don't understand the patriarchal order, or maybe don't understand or believe that marriage is an equal companionship, and that holding the priesthood does not imply any kind of superiority. In other words, the priesthood legitimizes the Church, but individuals do not need to hold the priesthood to be legitimized
  * Struggle to accept something that has not been revealed - This can be hard for me, because I have a compulsive drive to know and understand, but this is nothing more or less than a tough test of humility and patience
  * Struggle to accept the fact that we were born as part of the <1% of all people who have ever lived on the Earth and are bizarrely blessed with liberty, prosperity, and happiness, or in other words, a struggle with the concept of fairness - This one gets to me a lot, but it’s not one that can prove anything about truth; it’s just hard to accept that I am so blessed and easy to wonder why. The parables of the talents and of the laborers in the vineyard have helped me come to terms with this, as does Luke 12:48, and this is definitely a topic I still have a lot to study on. It’s interesting to think about the special missions we have, and nice to remember that it’s not about being better or worse, just about doing the best we can with what we’re given and helping others to do the same.
    Why I believe: I have felt the Spirit’s witness that this Church, despite its imperfect past and imperfect nature, is the one set up by Jesus Christ. Having an open mind dictates that if you were to find more truth and light anywhere else, you would go there. I have had my eyes open, and I haven’t found any church or other group or system of belief that fit the bill. There is nowhere else you can learn so much about Jesus Christ and His Gospel, and nowhere else you can find opportunities to do so much good. In addition to the Spirit’s witness, the evidence for the Church outweighs any evidence against it, and the most logical decision I have found is to accept it and to live by it, and to help others do the same. As Alma 32 and John 7:17 promise, living the Gospel is its own best proof.
    Sometimes I’m a little jealous that you’re still a missionary, and I miss my own time as a missionary. It really is a wonderful feeling that can be easy to take for granted, and I’m so grateful I got to serve. Thanks for writing good emails every week.
    Love,
