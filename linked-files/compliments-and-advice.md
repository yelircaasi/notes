Compliments

Elder Henrik Osthed: “I honestly feel so lucky to have served with you. You taught me so many things. … You made me feel important and needed. You helped me understand just how much I can be with the Lord’s help. You are a wonderful man, a wonderful missionary, and a classy southern-German-Guamish-English gent. Though I use humor, I hope you understand that I mean all of this. You have changed my life for the better.

Thank you for the laughs, thank you for taking time and listening even when you might not have wanted to, thank you for being a strong, quiet example, thank you for helping me see my worth, thank you for picking me up when I fall down, thank you for helping me be healthier, thank you for always being honest, thank you for supporting my weaknesses, but most of all, thank you for being my friend. It means the world to me. I am so glad the Lord put you in my life.

You were just what I needed. Best companion I ever did have. I would follow you anywhere my friend.”

Sister Renee Andrade: “Let me take the opportunity to tell you a few great things about yourself:

1. You’ve got a great British accent. Can you keep it permanently? No. Can you use it on special occasions? Most definitely.
2. You are a great teacher. You really listen.
3. You are probably the most, the very most dedicated, diligent person in the entire world. It’s inspiring, really. I want to be you!
4. You play a mean game of fooseball (don’t know if that’s spelled right). Rematch! For sure.
5. You think you are a mountain man / jungle native hybrid. I know it’s true. Why else would you play sports barefoot with such agility? It’s great.

I hope we get to serve together again; I’ve only scraped the surface of your wisdom and experience! You are a great missionary. Keep it up! See you around!

Sister Julie Ricks: “...you are a great missionary. You’re talented at singing, playing piano, learning languages, ping-pong, writing interesting books - the list goes on. But through it all, you do have humility. And not the annoying kind of fake humility where you try to tell everyone you’re no good (or else I probably would have thrown a book at you). You’re just a completely honest person, thank you.

Elder Hales: “I remember way back when, when I got to Ukraine. I think it was my second transfer and we were at zone sports. Everyone was talking aout how good this Elder Riley was at Russian and how good he was at soccer. I remember talking to you and you were just super happy and way excited about everything. I thought you were like way old in the mission and getting ready to go home but I found out by Elder Gelwix after zone sports that you were only like 2 transfers older than me! I thought man, I want to be like Elder Riley!

Elder Forrest Hangen: “Well, we only got to serve together for a few days, but man did we get some amazing work done! I mean this when I say it, you are my favorite companion so far!”

Sister Krystal Hassard: “First of all, I just have to say that you are outstanding, definitely one of the best missionaries that I know. You work so hard, and it shows.

Also your Russian is boss and I know that is due to the hard work you put into it every day. Thank you for giving me tips!

Thanks for being a great example, but more than that a friend.

...you just know how to get things done. You love work, and that says a ton! I guess you could sum a lot of it up and just say that you are focused. That is a trait that takes a lot of developing.”

Sister Alisa Winterton: “I’m super blessed that I was able to serve around you and especially when I first got into country. I learned so much from you, not only from your (usually) always wise words of wisdom but also your example of hard work and dedication. I really look up to and admire you so much and in many ways hope to becme more like you. You are one of the smartest and most organized and most driven people I have met in my many 22 years so that means something. … Thanks for your encouragement with Russian and always telling me to not sell myself short. Really I am quite glad we are friends and I think you are quite a lovely human being. … Oh and another thing, thanks for always being sincerely excited for me. You have no idea how much that always meant. You’re a saint.”

Elder Britton Rice: “I had a blast with you. … I’m gonna miss you. I’m really looking forward to BYU. I learned a lot from you. We worked really hard and I really enjoyed chastny tracting and eating fruit with you. Also our shoe shining parties. You’re a wonderful missionary and you’re really going places, …

...You’re a wonderful person. I really did enjoy my time with you!”
