# Announcement Post
    This is a long, blunt, and fairly personal open letter. If you are in the mood for cat videos right now, or if you hardly know me, scroll on.
    I'm a Mormon, born and raised. Most of my great-grandparents were Mormon and lived in Utah. I was amused, but not too surprised, when I learned that Mormonism is considered its own ethnicity by some ethnologists. In that sense, I will always be Mormon. It is my heritage, my culture, and my community. It has shaped me in countless ways. I am no longer a Mormon, though, in the sense that a Mormon believes the truth claims of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I think it's only fair to my friends and extended family to be transparent and be the first to break the news.
    One of the most important reasons I share this publicly is that I prefer to preempt the rumors and speculations. Another is that there are also a number of incorrect ideas perpetuated by the LDS church and its membership about "apostates" who no longer believe, so I want to address those here. I want to do what I can against the intense pressure to remain silent that many sincere doubters experience, and create opportunities for honest and open discussion. I also want to be clear that I do not want to be anyone's enemy because of my change of belief, and that I don't want this to damage any relationships. The LDS church has so much beauty and goodness that I still love, and I don’t want to take them away from anyone. I’m still a friend and an ally, not a scary enemy who needs to be shunned.
    I take complete responsibility for this. It wasn't Sandra's doing, nor my parents, siblings, or LDS friends. They have done nothing wrong and nearly everything right. They still believe, and they did all they could to help me maintain belief for as long as possible. I still participate in many of the rituals and traditions, especially with Sandra. Church activity and involvement are a force for good in her life, and anything that benefits Sandra is a good thing in my book.  Again, please understand that my friends and family did all they could. This obviously wasn't the result of peer pressure I experienced at BYU. I deserve all the blame.
    This is the result of my honest search for truth. I didn't begin to doubt because I wanted to doubt or because I wanted to rebel; I came across historical, theological, and scientific contradictions in my beliefs that I needed to resolve, and defending my faith, both to myself and others, was an important part of my spiritual life for years. I did doubt my doubts before doubting my faith, and I wanted the beliefs I loved to be true. I researched them in depth for years, trying to make it work. I didn't want an excuse to sin; my lifestyle and personal ethical code are essentially what they were before, and in some ways better. I wasn't offended by anyone. I didn't get lazy or tired of keeping the commandments, although once I no longer believed, some of them lost meaning for me. Those who know me well know how firmly I believed and how diligently I tried to live in accordance with my beliefs. I didn't stop reading the scriptures, or praying, or going to church; I became more diligent with all three while looking for answers, because I desperately wanted the beliefs I had built my life on to be true. Even now, I still do all three with Sandra. I haven't forgotten my spiritual experiences; I remember them well and they mean very much to me, but I understand them differently now. Even more importantly, even as a non-believer, I still experience the same feelings I had learned to identify as the Holy Spirit.
    I didn't doubt my faith because of social issues; it would be insane to sacrifice eternal salvation because of differences of opinion and things that I didn't understand. It was the other way around; as my trust in religion faded, social views that I had held on no other grounds other than that trust, and in spite of good arguments against them, became obsolete.
    Some believers will want to write me off as deceived by Satan; if I have been, it's hard to understand why I continue to enjoy the "fruits of the Spirit: ... love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance" (Galatians 5:22-23). I'm not exceptionally good, but I'm no worse a person than I was earlier as an extremely devout believer. I feel at peace with my decision. But anyone who refuses to accept that I honestly arrived at a different conclusion and simply see things differently will have to write me off as hoodwinked by the devil. The impulse to shelter one's beliefs by demonizing those who believe differently is powerful, but I hope for a little more charity than that. If there has to be a faith-promoting narrative, let it be an honest mistake on my part, rather than a demonic possession.
    I don't think it's fair to put it all down to pride. If thinking freely and independently is pride, I can plead guilty to that. But I once saw myself as one of the privileged few born and raised in the One True Church, and now I don't. I'm now longer one of the "elect"  or part of the "chosen generation." I don't see myself as a bearer of God's exclusive power. All of the teachings that reinforced a sense of my own "specialness" are out of the picture for me. I've accepted the possibility that I may have been wrong about a lot of things. There are a lot of things I don't know, and I don't have all the answers. Having recognized these things, some of them the hard way, I now feel more humble, or humbled, than I was before.
    Sometimes being too intellectual is equated with pride. I am familiar with Proverbs 3:5-6, Isaiah 55:8-9 and 2 Nephi 9:28-29. But for each of those, you have Zechariah 8:16, John 8:32, Ephesians 4:25, and D&C 93:24. I feel a moral imperative to search for the truth, and I eventually reached a point in my life where I decided to search for the truth, even if that search took me away from the faith I was raised in. Whether anti-intellectualism is a divine condemnation of my Enlightenment values or a manipulative tactic is a matter of individual judgment, but it seems suspect to me. The truth has nothing to fear from honest inquiry.
    My other reason for sharing this is that I want to express my hopes and concerns regarding my change of belief. I don't want to threaten anyone else's faith, although by posting this, I may have unintentionally done so already. If someone questions my thinking, I can explain myself, and I am capable of defending my views if necessary, but I don't want to be seen as a threat. I support anyone's faith if it helps them to be happy and kind, and I also want to express my sympathy for those who doubt. I know there are many Mormons who have sincere doubts and don't feel comfortable talking to most people about them, and my heart goes out to the doubters. It's not an easy cross to bear, and the church community can be an unforgiving environment for those with uncomfortable questions. It's good to doubt, and it's good to have faith, and while I don't think much of either faith or doubt founded on a denial of the truth, I support anyone's honest faith and honest doubts. Reasonable people sometimes look at the same reality and draw different conclusions.
    I have given years of my life to the LDS church. I like to think I have done some good through my activity and service, and I will continue to support the good the church does. Just as I have criticized its abuses as a believer, I will continue to be critical of any damage my church does. This doesn't make me an "angry anti-mormon who just can't leave the church alone." I'm just someone who does not see his church and the culture it creates as infallible or above reproach, and who does not want to be complicit in the harm it sometimes causes. I hope to maintain my friendships. I still want to belong. I still love my family, friends, and community. I respect the sincere beliefs I disagree with, and that same courtesy is all I ask for. I don't insist on being understood, but it is always nice to feel that way.
    Finally, I know this may be sad and shocking, especially for the most devout of my LDS family and friends. The emphasis on families eternally sealed together by the priesthood makes it especially hard when a family member no longer believes. If it helps, you can comfort yourselves with the thought that the lower kingdom you will see me on track for is much better than the fate Catholics, Muslims, Baptists, etc., and maybe even Buddhists expect for all of us in the next life. Resurrection as an angel of telestial glory still beats reincarnation as a sea cucumber, after all. What's more, you can hope that a kind, loving God will allow you to visit me, and I may even be fortunate enough to be your servant. Let's not forget, though, that this life is different. So much of what we enjoy is transient - good food, beautiful views, enjoyable entertainment, fun times with friends, and so on. Each of those things builds us up and often has a lasting effect on us, even if we cannot take those things themselves with us. If according to your beliefs, I become just another transient part of your life, instead of a part of the celestial eternal family, so be it. I hope you can still allow me to be a meaningful part of your life, even if I am a spiritual alien.
    I've had the benefit of a long, gradual process, and it has still been rough, so you have my sympathies if this feels sudden. It must be hard to see someone reject something that means so much to you, and that seems so obviously true. It hasn't been completely easy for me either. Some people speak of their path to disbelief as a triumph or as "seeing the light," but I think there are better ways to describe it. Like Truman leaving his arena, Rapunzel leaving her tower, or Dorothy and friends traveling to meet the great Wizard of Oz, this has been a journey away from comfort and certainty and into the great unknown.
    I hope this doesn't ruin our relationship. If it's best to just disagree without discussion, I understand, but for those of you who want to understand my thinking and how I have come to believe as I do, I have links attached below. Please know that I am happy to discuss ideas and beliefs with anyone. I didn't abandon one set of dogmata just to embrace another, so I'm still searching with an open mind. I expect I always will.
