# Idea Evolution

    # Countless Cases Of Idea Evolution
    I     share all of the quotes below from famous thinkers so you can see the    extent to which the idea evolution is embedded in many different fields.     These individuals aren’t outliers with a unique approach. Rather they    are the norm of how creativity actually works.
    ### Combinatorial creativity in mathematics
    > “It is obvious that invention or discovery, be it in mathematics or anywhere else, takes place by combining ideas.”—Jacques Hadamard, Mathematician    >
    > “Ideas rose in crowds; I felt them collide until pairs interlocked, so to speak, making a stable combination.”—Henri Poincaré, Mathematician    >
    ### Combinatorial creativity in economics
    > “Improvements in machinery [result from in part] combining together the powers of the most distant and dissimilar objects.”—Adam Smith    >
    > “To produce means to combine the things and forces within our reach.”—Joseph Schumpeter    >
    > “New     technologies are never created from nothing. They are constructed – put     together – from components that previously exist; and in turn these new     technologies offer themselves as possible components – building blocks –     for the construction of further new technologies.”—Economists Brian Arthur & Wolgang Polak    >
    ### Combinatorial creativity in invention
    > “90 percent of inventions combine at least two codes, showing that invention is increasingly a combinatorial process.”—Dashun Wang & Albert-László Barabasi in Science Of Science    >    >    > *“Creativity    >  is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did    > something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it,    > they just saw something.”—*Steve Jobs    >
    > “Invention     finds its distinctive feature in the constructive assimilation of    preexisting elements into new syntheses, new patterns, or new    configurations of behavior.”—Abbott Payson, Researcher, History Of Mechanical Invention    >
    > The     great driver of scientific and technological innovation [in the last    600 years has been] the increase in our ability to reach out and    exchange ideas with other people, and to borrow other people’s hunches    and combine them with our hunches and turn them into something new.    >    >    > —[Steven Johnson](https://open.substack.com/users/1408434-steven-johnson) , author of [Where Good Ideas Come From](https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/9345f93a-fe63-4794-b167-12a93cfc27a1?j=eyJ1IjoiMTZncWkifQ.7ZDFSaslJu744-faP9vNPQEpLdW-p0iUe4Hjq_d_CRY)    >
    ### Combinatorial creativity in other fields
    > “Combinatorial play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought.” —Albert Einstein    >
    > “The philosopher must form a new combination of ideas concerning the combination of ideas.” —Jacques Derrida, Philosopher    >
    > “Each     new machine or technique, in a sense, changes all existing machines and     techniques, by permitting us to put them together into new    combinations. The number of possible combinations rises exponentially as     the number of new machines or techniques rises arithmetically. Indeed,    each new combination may, itself, be regarded as a new super-machine.”—Alvin Toffler, Futurist    >
    > “In the course of creative endeavors, artists and scientists join fragments of knowledge into a new unity of understanding.”    >    >    > —Vera John-Steiner, Psycholinguist    >
    ### Combinatorial creativity in the arts
    > “Don’t     be so all-fired concerned about being original. You hear an old song    you like but you’d like to change a little, there’s no crime in changing     a little…    >    >    > *It’s    >  a process. It’s not any particular song, it’s not any particular    > singer. It’s a process by which ordinary people take over old songs and    > make them their own.”*    >    > —Pete Seeger, Singer, in [Songwriters On Songwriting](https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/687ec851-4eb9-4b05-84c4-fc4d7e93575e?j=eyJ1IjoiMTZncWkifQ.7ZDFSaslJu744-faP9vNPQEpLdW-p0iUe4Hjq_d_CRY)    >
    > “Substantially     all ideas are second-hand, consciously and unconsciously drawn from a    million outside sources, and daily use by the garnerer with a pride and    satisfaction born of the superstition that he originated them.”—Mark Twain, Writer    >
    > “Even     the most original song you can think of is liable to have a good deal    of tradition in it. After all, the major scale and the minor scale were    invented thousands of years ago… And the English language was invented a     long time ago, and the phrases that we use. And we’re just rearranging    these ancient elements.”    >    >    > —Virginia Woolf, Writer    >
    ### Combinatorial creativity from creativity thinkers
    > “Ideas,     like species, naturally evolve over time. Existing concepts are altered     and combined to construct new concepts; the way geometry, trigonometry,     and algebra combine to form calculus.” —David Kord Murray, Borrowing Brilliance    >
    > “The     first [principle is] that an idea is nothing more nor less than a new    combination of old elements. The second important principle is that the    capacity to bring old elements into new combinations depends largely on    the ability to see relationships.”—James Webb Young (legendary creative in the advertising field)    >
    > “Nothing     is completely original. All artists’ work builds on what came before.    Every new idea is just a remix or a mashup of two previous ideas.” —Austin Kleon , Author of Steal Like An Artist    >
    > “You don’t really have a workable idea until you combine two ideas.” —Twyla Tharp, Dancer, Choreographer, Author    >
    Now     that you understand how ubiquitous idea evolution is, let’s explore how     powerful it is. When you fully assimilate the implications of the    mental model, you completely restructure your process for producing    ideas.
    Below is the workflow that I’ve refined over the years based on the idea evolution mental model…
    # The Idea Evolution Workflow (For Paid Subscribers)
    1. Research the best of what humanity has figured out so you can stand on the shoulders of giants    2. Collect diverse knowledge so you can make combinations no one else can    3. Build a memory system so you can automatically combine things in your head forever    4. Build a comprehensive notes system so you can cite quotes years later    5. Generate endless ideas via combinatorial creativity    6. Experiment with and then select ideas that can make your career    7. Package your ideas so they grab attention and spread virally

    And     I saw the mental model among greatest thinkers in history from    mathematicians to economists to philosophers to entrepreneurs to    technology researchers to futurists…
